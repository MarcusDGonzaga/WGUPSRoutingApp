# WGUPSRoutingApp
Western Governers University Postal Service Routing Application

The WGU Postal Service Routing Application was created in response to the "Traveling Salesman Problem." 

Utilizing a self adjusting data structure and named algorithm, I created a solution to deliver 40 packages
between 3 trucks that had a maximum capacity of 16 packages and 2 drivers. I had to take into account
specific conditions for certain packages and a maximum mileage of 140 miles for all packages delivered.
